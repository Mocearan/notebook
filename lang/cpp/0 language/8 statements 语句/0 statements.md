# statements

​		A computer program is a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do.

---

​		A **statement** is a type of instruction that causes the program to *perform some action*.

- smallest independent unit of computation in the C++ language

- end in a semicolon

  ​	a line that ends in a semicolon, it’s probably a statement.

## classification 分类

​		C++ includes the following types of statements：

- labeled statements;

- expression statements;

  ​	An **expression statement** is a statement that consists of an expression followed by a semicolon.

  ​	When the statement is executed, the expression will be evaluated (and the result of the expression will be discarded).

- compound statements;

- conditional statements;

- iteration statements（loop）;

- jump statements;

- declaration statements;

- try blocks;

- atomic and synchronized blocks (TM TS).



## compound statements

A **compound statement** (also called a **block**, or **block statement**) is a group of *zero or more statements* that is treated by the compiler as if it were a single statement.

`{...}`

> Blocks begin with a `{` symbol, end with a `}` symbol, with the statements to be executed being placed in between. Blocks can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed. No semicolon is needed at the end of a block.

### function body is a block

```c++
int add(int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}
```

### conditional statement blocks

One of the most common use cases for blocks is in conjunction with `if statements`.

```c++
if(val >= 0 ) {
    std::cout << value ,<< "is a positive integer (or zero)\n";
    std::cout << "Double this number is " << value * 2 << '\n';
} else {
    std::cout << value << " is a negative integer\n";
    std::cout << "The positive od this number is " << -value << 
        '\n';
}
```

### nested blocks

blocks can be nested inside other blocks.

```c++
int main()
{
    {
        auto val = add(3,4);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Despite what C++ technically supports, it’s a good idea to keep your nesting level to 3 or less.

## conditional statements

- if-else statement
- switch statement



## jump statements





## **flow control**

 allow the programmer to change the normal path of execution through the program.

Halts

​		A **halt** is a flow control statement that terminates the program. In C++, halts are implemented as functions (rather than keywords), so our halt statements will be function calls.

- `std::exit / std::atexit`
- `std::quick_exit / std::at_quick_exit`
- `std::abort`
- `std::terminate`

​		Destroying local objects is an important part of C++ (particularly when we get into classes), and none of the above-mentioned functions clean up local variables. Exceptions are a better and safer mechanism for handling error cases.

​		Only use a halt if there is no safe way to return normally from the main function. If you haven’t disabled exceptions, prefer using exceptions for handling errors safely.
