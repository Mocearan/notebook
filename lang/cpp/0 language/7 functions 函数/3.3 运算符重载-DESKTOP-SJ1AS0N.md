# Operator overloading

​		Using function overloading to overload operators is called **operator overloading**.

​		重载的运算符是具有特殊的函数名的函数.

---

​		In C++, operators are implemented as functions. By using function overloading on the operator functions, you can define your own versions of the operators that work with different data types (including classes that you’ve written). 



## 运算符重载分类

- 重载的运算符

  ```c++
  operator op
  ```

- 用户定义的转换函数

  ```c++
  operator type
  ```

- 内存管理函数

  ```c++
  operator new / delete
  operator new [] / delete []
  ```

- 用户定义字面量

  ```c++
  operator ""suffix-identifier	
  ```

- 用于`co_await`表达式的重载的`co_await`运算符

  ```c++
  operator co_await
  ```

  

## resolving overloaded operators 运算符重载决议

​		When evaluating an expression containing an operator, the compiler uses the following rules:

- If *all* of the operands are fundamental data types, the compiler will call a built-in routine if one exists. 
  - If one does not exist, the compiler will produce a compiler error.
- If *any* of the operands are user data types (e.g. one of your classes, or an enum type), the compiler looks to see whether the type has a matching overloaded operator function that it can call. 
  -  If it can’t find one, it will try to convert one or more of the user-defined type operands into fundamental data types so it can use a matching built-in operator (via an overloaded typecast).
  -  If it can’t find one, it will try to convert one or more of the user-defined type operands into fundamental data types so it can use a matching built-in operator (via an overloaded typecast, which we’ll cover later in this chapter).



## operator overloading limitations

- 不能重载的运算符

  - conditional  ``?:``
  - `sizeof`
  - `typeid`
  - scope  `::`
  - member selector `.`
  - member pointer selector `.*`
  - casting operators

- 只能重载现有运算符体系下的运算符

  ​	不能创建新的运算符

- 重载操作符中至少有一个操作数必须是用户定义的类型

- 不能改变运算符支持的操作数的个数

- 不能改变运算符的优先级和结合性

> ​		If the meaning of an overloaded operator is not clear and intuitive, use a named function instead.



## operator overloading ways

​		It turns out that there are three different ways to overload operators: 

- the member function way
  - The overloaded operator must be added as a member function of the left operand.
  - The left operand becomes the implicit *this object
  - All other operands become function parameters.
- the friend function way

  > 友元函数可以在类中实现，即便其不是类的成员。
- the normal function way. 

> `friend / normal function`本质上是一回事，只是决定是否要`friend`来破坏封装性。

> ​		The normal or friend function version has the added benefit of “symmetry”, as all operands become explicit parameters (instead of the left operand becoming *this and the right operand becoming an explicit parameter).

### 必须的成员函数重载

- assignment `=`
-  subscript ``[]``
- function call `()`
- member selection ``->`` 

​		语言的运算符定义要求这些运算符必须重载为成员函数。

> ​		operators must be overloaded as member functions, because the language requires them to be.

### 必须的非成员函数重载

​		因为一些运算符的成员函数重载形式，会注入一个外部的对象作为调用运算符的主体，要求该对象作为运算符的左操作数，但成员函数重载的形式，会将`hidden *this`作为第一个参数传递给左操作数。

​		This necessitates that `operator<<` be overloaded as a normal function (preferred) or a friend.

​		Typically, we won’t be able to use a member overload if the left operand is either not a class (e.g. int), or it is a class that we can’t modify (e.g. std::ostream).



### When to use a normal, friend, or member function overload

​		In most cases, the language leaves it up to you to determine whether you want to use the normal/friend or member function version of the overload. 

- When dealing with binary operators that don’t modify the left operand (e.g. operator+), the normal or friend function version is typically preferred.

  > ​		because it works for all parameter types (even when the left operand isn’t a class object, or is a class that is not modifiable).

- When dealing with binary operators that do modify the left operand (e.g. operator+=), the member function version is typically preferred. 

  > ​		having the object being modified become the one pointed to by *this is natural. 
  >
  > ​		Because the rightmost operand becomes an explicit parameter, there’s no confusion over who is getting modified and who is getting evaluated.

- Unary operators are usually overloaded as member functions as well, since the member version has no parameters.



## operator overloading rules

- If you’re overloading assignment (=), subscript ([]), function call (()), or member selection (->), do so as a member function.
- If you’re overloading a unary operator, do so as a member function.
- If you’re overloading a binary operator that does not modify its left operand (e.g. operator+), do so as a normal function (preferred) or friend function.
- If you’re overloading a binary operator that modifies its left operand, but you can’t add members to the class definition of the left operand (e.g. operator<<, which has a left operand of type ostream), do so as a normal function (preferred) or friend function.
- If you’re overloading a binary operator that modifies its left operand (e.g. operator+=), and you can modify the definition of the left operand, do so as a member function.
