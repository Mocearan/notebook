# Operator overloading

​		Using function overloading to overload operators is called **operator overloading**.

​		重载的运算符是具有特殊的函数名的函数.

---

​		In C++, operators are implemented as functions. By using function overloading on the operator functions, you can define your own versions of the operators that work with different data types (including classes that you’ve written). 



## 运算符重载分类

- 重载的运算符

  ```c++
  operator op
  ```

- 用户定义的转换函数

  ```c++
  operator type
  ```

- 内存管理函数

  ```c++
  operator new / delete
  operator new [] / delete []
  ```

- 用户定义字面量

  ```c++
  operator ""suffix-identifier	
  ```

- 用于`co_await`表达式的重载的`co_await`运算符

  ```c++
  operator co_await
  ```

  

## resolving overloaded operators 运算符重载决议

​		When evaluating an expression containing an operator, the compiler uses the following rules:

- If *all* of the operands are fundamental data types, the compiler will call a built-in routine if one exists. 
  - If one does not exist, the compiler will produce a compiler error.
- If *any* of the operands are user data types (e.g. one of your classes, or an enum type), the compiler looks to see whether the type has a matching overloaded operator function that it can call. 
  -  If it can’t find one, it will try to convert one or more of the user-defined type operands into fundamental data types so it can use a matching built-in operator (via an overloaded typecast).
  -  If it can’t find one, it will try to convert one or more of the user-defined type operands into fundamental data types so it can use a matching built-in operator (via an overloaded typecast, which we’ll cover later in this chapter).



## operator overloading limitations

- 不能重载的运算符

  - conditional  ``?:``
  - `sizeof`
  - `typeid`
  - scope  `::`
  - member selector `.`
  - member pointer selector `.*`
  - casting operators

- 只能重载现有运算符体系下的运算符

  ​	不能创建新的运算符

- 重载操作符中至少有一个操作数必须是用户定义的类型

- 不能改变运算符支持的操作数的个数

- 不能改变运算符的优先级和结合性



> ​		When overloading operators, it’s best to keep the function of the operators as close to the original intent of the operators as possible.

> ​		If the meaning of an overloaded operator is not clear and intuitive, use a named function instead.



## operator overloading ways

​		It turns out that there are three different ways to overload operators: 

- the member function way
  - The overloaded operator must be added as a member function of the left operand.
  - The left operand becomes the implicit *this object
  - All other operands become function parameters.
- the friend function way
- the normal function way. 

> `friend / normal function`本质上是一回事，只是决定是否要`friend`来破坏封装性。

> ​		The normal or friend function version has the added benefit of “symmetry”, as all operands become explicit parameters (instead of the left operand becoming *this and the right operand becoming an explicit parameter).

### Not everything can be overloaded as a friend function

​		The 

- assignment `=`
-  subscript ``[]``
- function call `()`
- member selection ``->`` 

​		operators must be overloaded as member functions, because the language requires them to be.

### Not everything can be overloaded as a member function

​		hidden ``*this`` added as this first parameter to member functions.

​		Because the overloaded operator must be added as a member of the left operand. 

​		This necessitates that operator<< be overloaded as a normal function (preferred) or a friend.

​		Typically, we won’t be able to use a member overload if the left operand is either not a class (e.g. int), or it is a class that we can’t modify (e.g. std::ostream).



### 如何选用normal、friend、member function进行重载

​		多数情况下，语言将实现的灵活性交由用户来决定。

> ​		In most cases, the language leaves it up to you to determine whether you want to use the normal/friend or member function version of the overload. 
>
> ​		而通常，在这两个选择中，往往有一个是更好的选择。

- 二元运算符的左操作数不被修改时，normal / friend function更好

  ​		When dealing with binary operators that don’t modify the left operand (e.g. operator+), the normal or friend function version is typically preferred.

  ​		因为非成员函数的实现，对左操作数没有要求，可以是任何类型。同时还有对称性的好处。

>
> ​		The normal or friend function version has the added benefit of “symmetry”, as all operands become explicit parameters (instead of the left operand becoming *this and the right operand becoming an explicit parameter).

- 二元运算符的左操作数被修改时，member function更好

  ​		When dealing with binary operators that do modify the left operand (e.g. operator+=), the member function version is typically preferred. 

  ​		having the object being modified become the one pointed to by *this is natural. 

  ​		此时左操作数是被修改的对象，`hidden *this`的语义很自然。

> ​		Because the rightmost operand becomes an explicit parameter, there’s no confusion over who is getting modified and who is getting evaluated.

- 一元运算符通常实现为member function，即便成员版本没有参数。

  



## operator overloading rules

- If you’re overloading assignment (=), subscript ([]), function call (()), or member selection (->), do so as a member function.
- If you’re overloading a unary operator, do so as a member function.
- If you’re overloading a binary operator that does not modify its left operand (e.g. operator+), do so as a normal function (preferred) or friend function.
- If you’re overloading a binary operator that modifies its left operand, but you can’t add members to the class definition of the left operand (e.g. operator<<, which has a left operand of type ostream), do so as a normal function (preferred) or friend function.
- If you’re overloading a binary operator that modifies its left operand (e.g. operator+=), and you can modify the definition of the left operand, do so as a member function.
