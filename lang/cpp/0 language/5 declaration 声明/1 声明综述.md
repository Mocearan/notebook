# 声明

​		声明将名字引入（或再引入）到c++程序中。

​		A **declaration** is a statement that tells the *compiler* about the existence of an identifier and its type information.

​	每种实体的声明方式都不同。

​	**定义**是一种声明，使得名字所标识的实体能够被使用。

> ​		Just like type aliases, program-defined types must also be defined before they can be used. The definition for a program-defined type is called a **type definition**.

> **定义：**

> ​		In C++, all definitions also serve as declarations.

> ​	定义是完全定义了声明中所引入的实体的声明。

​		**Type definitions are exempt from the one-definition rule**

​		**声明分为两种，引用性声明和定义性声明。**变量可以多次引用声明，但只能进行一次定义声明。

> These declarations that aren’t definitions are called **pure declarations**. Other types of pure declarations include forward declarations for variables and type declarations (you will encounter these in future lessons, no need to worry about them now).
>
> The ODR doesn’t apply to pure declarations (it’s the *one definition rule*, not the *one declaration rule*), so you can have as many pure declarations for an identifier as you desire (although having more than one is redundant).
