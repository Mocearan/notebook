## arithmetic operators 算数运算符

### unary 一元算数运算符

unary operators are operators that only take one operand.

- The **unary minus** operator returns the operand multiplied by -1.

- The **unary plus** operator returns the value of the operand. 

For best effect, both of these operators should be placed immediately preceding the operand



### binary

Binary operators are operators that take a left and right operand.

####  division

**Floating point division** returns a floating point value, and the fraction is kept. 

 **Integer division** drops any fractions and returns an integer value.

Trying to divide by 0 (or 0.0) will generally cause your program to crash, as the results are mathematically undefined! 	

#### modulus

The **modulus operator**  is an operator that returns the remainder after doing an integer division.

Modulus is most useful for testing whether a number is evenly divisible by another number

In both cases, you can see the remainder takes the sign of the first operand.

```c++
Enter an integer: -6
Enter another integer: 4
The remainder is: -2
-6 is not evenly divisible by 4
    
    
    
Enter an integer: 6
Enter another integer: -4
The remainder is: 2
6 is not evenly divisible by -4
```

#### exponent

C++ does not include an exponent operator.

To do exponents in C++, #include the <cmath> header, and use the pow() function:

```c++
#include <cmath>

double x{ std::pow(3.0, 4.0) }; // 3 to the 4th power
```

> Note that the parameters (and return value) of function pow() are of type double. Due to rounding errors in floating point numbers, the results of pow() may not be precise (even if you pass it integers or whole numbers).

integer exponentiation:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint> // for std::int64_t
#include <cassert> // for assert

// note: exp must be non-negative
std::int64_t powint(int base, int exp)
{
	assert(exp > 0 && "powint: exp parameter has negative value");

	std::int64_t result{ 1 };
	while (exp)
	{
		if (exp & 1)
			result *= base;
		exp >>= 1;
		base *= base;
	}

	return result;
}

int main()
{
	std::cout << powint(7, 12); // 7 to the 12th power

	return 0;
}
```





## assignment operators

![image-20220814192259581](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mocearan/picgo-server/main/image-20220814192259581.png)

After a variable has been defined, you can give it a value (in a separate statement) using the *= operator*. This process is called **copy assignment** (or just **assignment**) for short.

Assignment operators modify the value of the object.

```c++
int width; // define an integer variable named width
width = 5; // copy assignment of value 5 into variable width

// variable width now has value 5
```

> **copy:**
>
> ​		Copy assignment is named such because it copies the value on the right-hand side of the *= operator* to the variable on the left-hand side of the operator. The *= operator* is called the **assignment operator**.
>
> ​		*copy assignment* operator replaces the contents of the object `a` with a copy of the contents of `b` (`b` is not modified).

## Increment / decrement operators

![image-20220814192234973](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mocearan/picgo-server/main/image-20220814192234973.png)

The prefix increment/decrement operators are very straightforward. First, the operand is incremented or decremented, and then expression evaluates to the value of the operand.

The postfix increment/decrement operators are trickier. First, a copy of the operand is made. Then the operand (not the copy) is incremented or decremented. Finally, the copy (not the original) is evaluated. 

Note that the postfix version takes a lot more steps, and thus may not be as performant as the prefix version.

Strongly favor the prefix version of the increment and decrement operators, as they are generally more performant, and you’re less likely to run into strange issues with them.



```c++
#include <iostream>

int add(int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    int value{ add(x, ++x) }; // is this 5 + 6, or 6 + 6?
    // It depends on what order your compiler evaluates the function arguments in

    std::cout << value << '\n'; // value could be 11 or 12, depending on how the above line evaluates!
    return 0;
}
```

These problems can generally *all* be avoided by ensuring that any variable that has a side-effect applied is used no more than once in a given statement.



## Comma and conditional operators

### comma operator

![image-20220814192146450](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mocearan/picgo-server/main/image-20220814192146450.png)

The **comma operator (,)** allows you to evaluate multiple expressions wherever a single expression is allowed. 

The comma operator evaluates the left operand, then the right operand, and then returns the result of the right operand.

Note that comma has the lowest precedence of all the operators, even lower than assignment.

```c++
z = (a, b); // evaluate (a, b) first to get result of b, then assign that value to variable z.
z = a, b; // evaluates as "(z = a), b", so z gets assigned the value of a, and b is evaluated and discarded.
```



### conditonal operator

![image-20220814192203249](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mocearan/picgo-server/main/image-20220814192203249.png)

The ?: operator provides a shorthand method for doing a particular type of if/else statement.

The ?: operator takes the following form:

```
(condition) ? expression1 : expression2;
// 等效于
if (condition)
    statement1;
else
    statement2;
```

It is common convention to put the conditional part of the operation inside of parentheses, both to make it easier to read, and also to make sure the precedence is correct.

Note that the ?: operator has a very low precedence.

```c++
std::cout << ((x > y) ? x : y);
```

Because the conditional operator operands are expressions rather than statements, the conditional operator can be used in some places where if/else can not.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    constexpr bool inBigClassroom { false };
    constexpr int classSize { inBigClassroom ? 30 : 20 };
    std::cout << "The class size is: " << classSize << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

To properly comply with C++’s type checking, either the type of both expressions in a conditional statement must match, or the both expressions must be convertible to a common type.

The compiler is unable to determine a common type for expressions of these types. In such cases, you’ll have to use an if/else.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    constexpr int x{5};
    std::cout <<(x!=5 ? x:"x is 5");
    return 0;
}
```

**So when should you use the conditional operator?**

Only use the conditional operator for simple conditionals where you use the result and where it enhances readability.



## Relational operators

![image-20220814192328209](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mocearan/picgo-server/main/image-20220814192328209.png)

**Relational operators** are operators that let you compare two values. 

Each of these operators evaluates to the boolean value true (1), or false (0).

- These operators are extremely straightforward to use when comparing integers.

- By default, conditions in an *if statement* or *conditional operator* (and a few other places) evaluate as Boolean values.

  - Don’t add unnecessary == or != to conditions. It makes them harder to read without offering any additional value.

- Comparison of floating point values can be problematic

  ```c++
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
      double d1{ 100.0 - 99.99 }; // should equal 0.01
      double d2{ 10.0 - 9.99 }; // should equal 0.01
  
      if (d1 == d2)
          std::cout << "d1 == d2" << '\n';
      else if (d1 > d2)
          std::cout << "d1 > d2" << '\n';
      else if (d1 < d2)
          std::cout << "d1 < d2" << '\n';
  
      return 0;
  }	
  
  // d1 > d2
  
  // d1 = 0.0100000000000005116 and d2 = 0.0099999999999997868. 
  // Both numbers are close to 0.01, but d1 is greater than, and d2 is less than.
  ```

  ​		If a high level of precision is required, comparing floating point values using any of the relational operators can be dangerous. This is because floating point values are not precise, and small rounding errors in the floating point operands may cause unexpected results. 

  - Avoid using operator== and operator!= with floating point operands.

  -  When the less than and greater than operators (<, <=, >, and >=) are used with floating point values, they will usually produce the correct answer (only potentially failing when the operands are almost identical). 

  - **Comparing floating point numbers**

    ```c++
    #include <cmath> // for std::abs()
    
    // epsilon is an absolute value
    bool approximatelyEqualAbs(double a, double b, double absEpsilon)
    {
        // if the distance between a and b is less than absEpsilon, then a and b are "close enough"
        return std::abs(a - b) <= absEpsilon;
    }      	
    
    // On the right side of the <= operator, we need to calculate the largest value of “close enough” we’re willing to accept. To do this, the algorithm chooses the larger of a and b (as a rough indicator of the overall magnitude of the numbers), and then multiplies it by relEpsilon. In this function, relEpsilon represents a percentage. For example, if we want to say “close enough” means a and b are within 1% of the larger of a and b, we pass in an relEpsilon of 0.01 (1% = 1/100 = 0.01). The value for relEpsilon can be adjusted to whatever is most appropriate for the circumstances (e.g. an epsilon of 0.002 means within 0.2%).
    ```

    Note that while the approximatelyEqual() function will work for most cases, it is not perfect, especially as the numbers approach zero.

    One way to avoid this is to use both an absolute epsilon and a relative epsilon :

    ```c++
    // return true if the difference between a and b is less than absEpsilon, or within relEpsilon percent of the larger of a and b
    bool approximatelyEqualAbsRel(double a, double b, double absEpsilon, double relEpsilon)
    {
        // Check if the numbers are really close -- needed when comparing numbers near zero.
        double diff{ std::abs(a - b) };
        if (diff <= absEpsilon)
            return true;
    
        // Otherwise fall back to Knuth's algorithm
        return (diff <= (std::max(std::abs(a), std::abs(b)) * relEpsilon));
    }
    ```

    Comparison of floating point numbers is a difficult topic, and there’s no “one size fits all” algorithm that works for every case.



## logic operators 逻辑运算符

​		逻辑运算符㝂算数类型以及指针类型的运算对象，将其转换为`bool`类型，最后返回一个`bool`类型的结果。

​		逻辑运算符提供了测试多重条件的能力。

![image-20220814192404379](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mocearan/picgo-server/main/image-20220814192404379.png)

### logic not

![image-20220814192420740](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mocearan/picgo-server/main/image-20220814192420740.png)

*logical NOT* flips a Boolean value from true to false, and vice-versa.

```c++
bool tooLarge { x > 100 }; // tooLarge is true if x > 100
if (!tooLarge)
    // do something with x
else
    // print an error
```

*logical NOT* has a very high level of precedence.

### logic or

![image-20220814192435646](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mocearan/picgo-server/main/image-20220814192435646.png)

```c++
if (value == 0 || value == 1 || value == 2 || value == 3)
     std::cout << "You picked 0, 1, 2, or 3\n";
```



### logic and

```c++
if (value > 10 && value < 20 && value != 16)
    // do something
else
    // do something else
```



> The ``&`` symbol tends to cause confusion because it has different meanings depending on context:
>
> - When following a type name, ``&`` denotes an lvalue reference: `int& ref`.
> - When used in a unary context in an expression, ``&`` is the address-of operator: `std::cout << &x`.
> - When used in a binary context in an expression, ``&`` is the Bitwise AND operator: `std::cout << x & y`.



### Short circuit evaluation 短路求值

​		如果左侧条件使得逻辑运算符引起的整个条件必为其值，则会立即从左侧条件返回。

​		如`&&`左为假，`||`左为真，则整个条件都相应必为其值。则短路直接返回。

​		Short circuit evaluation may cause *Logical OR* and *Logical AND* to not evaluate one operand. Avoid using expressions with side effects in conjunction with these operators.

​		The Logical OR and logical AND operators are an exception to the rule that the operands may evaluate in any order, as the standard explicitly states that the left operand must evaluate first.

​		Only the built-in versions of these operators perform short-circuit evaluation. If you overload these operators to make them work with your own types, those overloaded operators will not perform short-circuit evaluation.

​		因此，`&& / ||`具有控制求值顺序的功能：

```c++
while( p && !whitespace(*p)) ++p; // p 为nullptr不进行解引用，更不会
```



### mix

​		*logical AND* has higher precedence than *logical OR*, thus *logical AND* operators will be evaluated ahead of *logical OR* operators (unless they have been parenthesized).

​		When mixing *logical AND* and *logical OR* in a single expression, explicitly parenthesize each operation to ensure they evaluate how you intend.



### De Morgan’s law 德摩根法则

​		[De Morgan’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan's_laws) tells us how the *logical NOT* should be distributed in these cases:

- ``!(x && y)` is equivalent to `!x || !y`
- ``!(x || y)` is equivalent to `!x && !y`

![image-20220814192510520](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mocearan/picgo-server/main/image-20220814192510520.png)



### XOR operator

*Logical XOR* is a logical operator provided in some languages that is used to test whether an odd number of conditions is true.

![image-20220814192526197](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mocearan/picgo-server/main/image-20220814192526197.png)

C++ doesn’t provide a *logical XOR* operator. Unlike *logical OR* or *logical AND*, *logical XOR* cannot be short circuit evaluated. However, you can easily mimic *logical XOR* using the *inequality* operator (!=):

```c++
if (a != b) ...; // a XOR b, assuming a and b are Booleans
if (a != b != c != d) ... ;// a XOR b XOR c XOR d, assuming a, b, c, and d are Booleans

```

Note that the above XOR patterns only work if the operands are Booleans (not integers). If you need a form of *logical XOR* that works with non-Boolean operands, you can static_cast them to bool:

```c++
if (static_cast<bool>(a) != static_cast<bool>(b) != static_cast<bool>(c) != static_cast<bool>(d)) ... // a XOR b XOR c XOR d, for any type that can be converted to bool
```





###  逻辑运算符替代表示

C++ supports an alternative set of keywords for the operators that use words instead of symbols. 

![image-20220814192547619](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mocearan/picgo-server/main/image-20220814192547619.png)

## bitwise operators 位运算符

​		位运算符在分类上属于算术运算符。

On modern computer architectures, the smallest addressable unit of memory is a byte. Since all objects need to have unique memory addresses, this means objects must be at least one byte in size. 

 Modifying individual bits within an object is called **bit manipulation**.

Bit manipulation is also useful in encryption and compression algorithms.



### bit set

 When individual bits of an object are used as Boolean values, the bits are called **bit flags**.

> In computing, a flag is a value that acts as a signal for some function or process.

 we typically number the bits from right to left, starting with 0 (not 1). Each number denotes a **bit position**.

```
76543210  Bit position
00000101  Bit sequence
```

To define a set of bit flags, we’ll typically use an unsigned integer of the appropriate size , or std::bitset.

> Bit manipulation is one of the few times when you should unambiguously use unsigned integers (or std::bitset).

```c++
unsigned char bs; // 8 bits unsigned integer for bit flags

#include <bitset>
std::bitset<8> bs; // // 8 bits in size means room for 8 flags
```

std::bitset provides 4 key functions that are useful for doing bit manipulation:

- `test()` allows us to query whether a bit is a 0 or 1
- `set()` allows us to turn a bit on (this will do nothing if the bit is already on)
- `reset()` allows us to turn a bit off (this will do nothing if the bit is already off)
- `flip()` allows us to flip a bit value from a 0 to a 1 or vice versa

```c++
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::bitset<8> bits{0b0000'0101};
    bits.set(3); // 0b0000'1101
    bits.flip(4); // 0b0001'1101
    bits.reset(4); // 0b0000'1101
    
    std::cout << "All the bits: " << bits << '\n';
    std::cout << "Bit 3 has value: " << bits.test(3) << '\n';
    std::cout << "Bit 4 has value: " << bits.test(4) << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```



### operators

![image-20220814192609158](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mocearan/picgo-server/main/image-20220814192609158.png)

To avoid surprises, use the bitwise operators with unsigned operands or std::bitset.



#### Bitwise shift

The **bitwise left shift** (<<) operator shifts bits to the left. The left operand is the expression to shift the bits of, and the right operand is an integer number of bits to shift left by.

The **bitwise right shift** (>>) operator shifts bits to the right.

```
0011 << 1 is 0110
0011 << 2 is 1100
0011 << 3 is 1000

1100 >> 1 is 0110
1100 >> 2 is 0011
1100 >> 3 is 0001

 in the third case we shifted a bit off the end(front or rear) of the number, so it is lost.
```

```c++
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::bitset<4> x { 0b1100 };

    std::cout << x << '\n';
    std::cout << (x >> 1) << '\n'; // shift right by 1, yielding 0110
    std::cout << (x << 1) << '\n'; // shift left by 1, yielding 1000

    return 0;
}
```

Note that if you’re using operator << for both output and left shift, parenthesization is required:

```c++
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::bitset<4> x{0b0110};
    
    std::cout <<x << 1 <<'\n'; // x, 1
    std::cout << (x<<1) << '\n'; // x << 1
}
```



#### bitwise not

The **bitwise NOT** operator (~) simply flips each bit from a 0 to a 1, or vice versa.

```
Flipping 4 bits:
~0100 is 1011

Flipping 8 bits:
~0000 0100 is 1111 1011
```

(binary 0100 is the same as 0000 0100 in the same way that decimal 7 is the same as 07), but we end up with a different result.

```c++
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << ~std::bitset<4>{0b0100} << ' ' << ~std::bitset<8>{0b0100};
    return 0;
}
```

#### bitwise or

**Bitwise OR** (|) works much like its *logical OR* counterpart. 

However, instead of applying the *OR* to the operands to produce a single result, *bitwise OR* applies to each bit! 

```
0 1 1 1 OR
0 0 1 1 OR
0 0 0 1
--------
0 1 1 10 1 0 1 OR
0 1 1 0
-------
0 1 1 1
```

```c++
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout <<(std::bitset<4>{ 0b0101 } 
                 | std::bitset<4>{ 0b0110 } 
                 | std::bitset<4>{ 0b0001 });
    return 0;
}
```



#### Bitwise AND

**Bitwise AND** (&) works similarly to the above. *Logical AND* evaluates to true if both the left and right operand evaluate to *true*. *Bitwise AND* evaluates to *true (1)* if both bits in the column are *1*.

```
0 0 0 1 AND
0 0 1 1 AND
0 1 1 1
--------
0 0 0 1
```

```c++
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << (std::bitset<4>{ 0b0001 } & std::bitset<4>{ 0b0011 } & std::bitset<4>{ 0b0111 });

	return 0;
}
```



#### **Bitwise XOR**

 **bitwise XOR** (^), also known as **exclusive or**.

 XOR evaluates to *true (1)* if one *and only one* of its operands is *true (1)*. If neither or both are true, it evaluates to *0*. 



#### **Bitwise assignment operators**

C++ provides bitwise assignment operators in order to facilitate easy modification of variables.

![image-20220814192631353](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mocearan/picgo-server/main/image-20220814192631353.png)

```c++
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>

int main(void)
{
    std::bitset<4> bits{0b1111};
    bits >>= 1;
    std::cout << bits;
}
```



### bit masks

A **bit mask** is a predefined set of bits that is used to select which specific bits will be modified by subsequent operations.

the bit mask blocks the bitwise operators from touching bits we don’t want modified, and allows access to the ones we do want modified.

Although bit masks can be literals, they’re often defined as symbolic constants so they can be given a meaningful name and easily reused.

- c++14

  ```c++
  #include <cstdint>
  
  constexpr std::uint8_t mask0{ 0b0000'0001 }; // represents bit 0
  constexpr std::uint8_t mask1{ 0b0000'0010 }; // represents bit 1
  constexpr std::uint8_t mask2{ 0b0000'0100 }; // represents bit 2
  constexpr std::uint8_t mask3{ 0b0000'1000 }; // represents bit 3
  constexpr std::uint8_t mask4{ 0b0001'0000 }; // represents bit 4
  constexpr std::uint8_t mask5{ 0b0010'0000 }; // represents bit 5
  constexpr std::uint8_t mask6{ 0b0100'0000 }; // represents bit 6
  constexpr std::uint8_t mask7{ 0b1000'0000 }; // represents bit 7
  ```

- c++11

  ​	C++11 doesn’t support binary literals, we have to use other methods to set the symbolic constants. There are two good methods for doing this. 

  - Less comprehensible, but more common, is to use hexadecimal. 

    ```c++
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask0{ 0x1 }; // hex for 0000 0001
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask1{ 0x2 }; // hex for 0000 0010
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask2{ 0x4 }; // hex for 0000 0100
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask3{ 0x8 }; // hex for 0000 1000
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask4{ 0x10 }; // hex for 0001 0000
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask5{ 0x20 }; // hex for 0010 0000
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask6{ 0x40 }; // hex for 0100 0000
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask7{ 0x80 }; // hex for 1000 0000
    ```

  - One way to make it easier is to use the left-shift operator to shift a bit into the proper location:

    ```c++
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask0{ 1 << 0 }; // 0000 0001
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask1{ 1 << 1 }; // 0000 0010
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask2{ 1 << 2 }; // 0000 0100
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask3{ 1 << 3 }; // 0000 1000
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask4{ 1 << 4 }; // 0001 0000
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask5{ 1 << 5 }; // 0010 0000
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask6{ 1 << 6 }; // 0100 0000
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask7{ 1 << 7 }; // 1000 0000
    ```

  

  

#### testing a bit

​		To determine if a bit is on or off, we use *bitwise AND* in conjunction with the bit mask for the appropriate bit:

```c++
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	constexpr std::uint8_t mask0{ 0b0000'0001 }; // represents bit 0
	constexpr std::uint8_t mask1{ 0b0000'0010 }; // represents bit 1
	constexpr std::uint8_t mask2{ 0b0000'0100 }; // represents bit 2
	constexpr std::uint8_t mask3{ 0b0000'1000 }; // represents bit 3
	constexpr std::uint8_t mask4{ 0b0001'0000 }; // represents bit 4
	constexpr std::uint8_t mask5{ 0b0010'0000 }; // represents bit 5
	constexpr std::uint8_t mask6{ 0b0100'0000 }; // represents bit 6
	constexpr std::uint8_t mask7{ 0b1000'0000 }; // represents bit 7

	std::uint8_t flags{ 0b0000'0101 }; // 8 bits in size means room for 8 flags

	std::cout << "bit 0 is " << ((flags & mask0) ? "on\n" : "off\n");
	std::cout << "bit 1 is " << ((flags & mask1) ? "on\n" : "off\n");

	return 0;
}
```



#### setting a bit

To set (turn on) a bit, we use bitwise OR equals (operator |=) in conjunction with the bit mask for the appropriate bit:

```c++
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask0{ 0b0000'0001 }; // represents bit 0
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask1{ 0b0000'0010 }; // represents bit 1

    std::uint8_t flags{ 0b0000'0101 }; // 8 bits in size means room for 8 flags

    std::cout << "bit 1 is " << ((flags & mask1) ? "on\n" : "off\n");

    flags |= mask1; // turn on bit 1

    std::cout << "bit 1 is " << ((flags & mask1) ? "on\n" : "off\n");

    return 0;
}
```

We can also turn on multiple bits at the same time using *Bitwise OR*:

```c++
flags |= (mask4 | mask5); // turn bits 4 and 5 on at the same time
```



#### resetting a bit

To clear a bit (turn off), we use *Bitwise AND* and *Bitwise NOT* together:

```c++
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	constexpr std::uint8_t mask2{ 0b0000'0100 }; // represents bit 2
    std::uint8_t flags{ 0b0000'0101 }; // 8 bits in size means room for 8 flags

    std::cout << "bit 2 is " << ((flags & mask2) ? "on\n" : "off\n");

    flags &= ~mask2; // turn off bit 2

    std::cout << "bit 2 is " << ((flags & mask2) ? "on\n" : "off\n");

    return 0;
}
```

We can turn off multiple bits at the same time:

```c++
flags &= ~(mask4 | mask5); // turn bits 4 and 5 off at the same time
```



#### flipping a bit

To toggle a bit state, we use *Bitwise XOR*:

```c++
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    constexpr std::uint8_t mask2{ 0b0000'0100 }; // represents bit 2

    std::uint8_t flags{ 0b0000'0101 }; // 8 bits in size means room for 8 flags

    std::cout << "bit 2 is " << ((flags & mask2) ? "on\n" : "off\n");
    flags ^= mask2; // flip bit 2
    std::cout << "bit 2 is " << ((flags & mask2) ? "on\n" : "off\n");
    flags ^= mask2; // flip bit 2
    std::cout << "bit 2 is " << ((flags & mask2) ? "on\n" : "off\n");

    return 0;
}
```

We can flip multiple bits simultaneously:

```c++
flags ^= (mask4 | mask5); // flip bits 4 and 5 at the same time
```



#### mask / bitset funciton

 The functions of `std::bitset` to modify bit only allow you to modify individual bits. The bitwise operators allow you to modify multiple bits at once.

```c++
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

int main()
{
	constexpr std::bitset<8> mask0{ 0b0000'0001 }; // represents bit 0
	constexpr std::bitset<8> mask1{ 0b0000'0010 }; // represents bit 1

	std::bitset<8> flags{ 0b0000'0101 }; // 8 bits in size means room for 8 flags
	std::cout << "bit 1 is " << (flags.test(1) ? "on\n" : "off\n");
	std::cout << "bit 2 is " << (flags.test(2) ? "on\n" : "off\n");

	flags ^= (mask1 | mask2); // flip bits 1 and 2
	std::cout << "bit 1 is " << (flags.test(1) ? "on\n" : "off\n");
	std::cout << "bit 2 is " << (flags.test(2) ? "on\n" : "off\n");

	flags |= (mask1 | mask2); // turn bits 1 and 2 on
	std::cout << "bit 1 is " << (flags.test(1) ? "on\n" : "off\n");
	std::cout << "bit 2 is " << (flags.test(2) ? "on\n" : "off\n");

	flags &= ~(mask1 | mask2); // turn bits 1 and 2 off
	std::cout << "bit 1 is " << (flags.test(1) ? "on\n" : "off\n");
	std::cout << "bit 2 is " << (flags.test(2) ? "on\n" : "off\n");

	return 0;
}
```



#### meaningful name of mask

A best practice is to give your bit masks useful names as a way to document the meaning of your bit flags.

```c++
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
        // Define a bunch of physical/emotional states
	constexpr std::uint8_t isHungry{	1 << 0 }; // 0000 0001
	constexpr std::uint8_t isSad{		1 << 1 }; // 0000 0010
	constexpr std::uint8_t isMad{		1 << 2 }; // 0000 0100
	constexpr std::uint8_t isHappy{		1 << 3 }; // 0000 1000
	constexpr std::uint8_t isLaughing{ 	1 << 4 }; // 0001 0000
	constexpr std::uint8_t isAsleep{	1 << 5 }; // 0010 0000
	constexpr std::uint8_t isDead{		1 << 6 }; // 0100 0000
	constexpr std::uint8_t isCrying{	1 << 7 }; // 1000 0000

	std::uint8_t me{}; // all flags/options turned off to start
	me |= (isHappy | isLaughing); // I am happy and laughing
	me &= ~isLaughing; // I am no longer laughing

	// Query a few states
	// (we'll use static_cast<bool> to interpret the results as a boolean value)
	std::cout << "I am happy? " << static_cast<bool>(me & isHappy) << '\n';
	std::cout << "I am laughing? " << static_cast<bool>(me & isLaughing) << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

int main()
{
        // Define a bunch of physical/emotional states
	constexpr std::bitset<8> isHungry{	0b0000'0001 };
	constexpr std::bitset<8> isSad{		0b0000'0010 };
	constexpr std::bitset<8> isMad{		0b0000'0100 };
	constexpr std::bitset<8> isHappy{	0b0000'1000 };
	constexpr std::bitset<8> isLaughing{	0b0001'0000 };
	constexpr std::bitset<8> isAsleep{	0b0010'0000 };
	constexpr std::bitset<8> isDead{	0b0100'0000 };
	constexpr std::bitset<8> isCrying{	0b1000'0000 };


	std::bitset<8> me{}; // all flags/options turned off to start
	me |= (isHappy | isLaughing); // I am happy and laughing
	me &= ~isLaughing; // I am no longer laughing

	// Query a few states (we use the any() function to see if any bits remain set)
	std::cout << "I am happy? " << (me & isHappy).any() << '\n';
	std::cout << "I am laughing? " << (me & isLaughing).any() << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

-  std::bitset doesn’t have a nice function that allows you to query bits using a bit mask. you’ll have to use *Bitwise AND* to query bits.
- any() function, which returns true if any bits are set, and false otherwise to see if the bit we queried remains on or off.

当函数设计接受多种不同的选项，以此进行不同的处理。则bit flags & bit masks就很有用。

```c++
void someFunction(std::bitset<32> options);
// Then you could use bit flags to pass in only the options you wanted:
someFunction(option10 | option32);
```



#### multiple bits masks

When assigning color values to a pixel, in addition to R, G, and B, a 4th value called A is often used.

R, G, B, and A are normally stored as a single 32-bit integer, with 8 bits used for each component:

![image-20220814192653718](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mocearan/picgo-server/main/image-20220814192653718.png)

```c++
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	constexpr std::uint32_t redBits{ 0xFF000000 };
	constexpr std::uint32_t greenBits{ 0x00FF0000 };
	constexpr std::uint32_t blueBits{ 0x0000FF00 };
	constexpr std::uint32_t alphaBits{ 0x000000FF };

	std::cout << "Enter a 32-bit RGBA color value in hexadecimal (e.g. FF7F3300): ";
	std::uint32_t pixel{};
	std::cin >> std::hex >> pixel; // std::hex allows us to read in a hex value

	// use Bitwise AND to isolate red pixels,
	// then right shift the value into the lower 8 bits
	std::uint8_t red{ static_cast<std::uint8_t>((pixel & redBits) >> 24) };
	std::uint8_t green{ static_cast<std::uint8_t>((pixel & greenBits) >> 16) };
	std::uint8_t blue{ static_cast<std::uint8_t>((pixel & blueBits) >> 8) };
	std::uint8_t alpha{ static_cast<std::uint8_t>(pixel & alphaBits) };

	std::cout << "Your color contains:\n";
	std::cout << std::hex; // print the following values in hex
	std::cout << static_cast<int>(red)   << " red\n";
	std::cout << static_cast<int>(green) << " green\n";
	std::cout << static_cast<int>(blue)  << " blue\n";
	std::cout << static_cast<int>(alpha) << " alpha\n";

	return 0;
}
```

### Ellipsis 省略号

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdarg> // needed to use ellipsis

// The ellipsis must be the last parameter
// count is how many additional arguments we're passing
double findAverage(int count, ...)
{
    int sum{ 0 };

    // We access the ellipsis through a va_list, so let's declare one
    std::va_list list;

    // We initialize the va_list using va_start.  The first parameter is
    // the list to initialize.  The second parameter is the last non-ellipsis
    // parameter.
    va_start(list, count);

    // Loop through all the ellipsis arguments
    for (int arg{ 0 }; arg < count; ++arg)
    {
         // We use va_arg to get parameters out of our ellipsis
         // The first parameter is the va_list we're using
         // The second parameter is the type of the parameter
         sum += va_arg(list, int);
    }

    // Cleanup the va_list when we're done.
    va_end(list);

    return static_cast<double>(sum) / count;
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << findAverage(5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) << '\n';
    std::cout << findAverage(6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) << '\n';
}
```

**Why ellipsis are dangerous:**

- **Type checking is suspended**

  ```c++
  std::cout << findAverage(6, 1.0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) << '\n';
  
  int value{ 7 };
  std::cout << findAverage(6, 1.0, 2, "Hello, world!", 'G', &value, &findAverage) << '\n';
  ```

- **ellipsis don’t know how many parameters were passed**

  - **Method 1: Pass a length parameter**

  - **Method 2: Use a sentinel value**

     A **sentinel** is a special value that is used to terminate a loop when it is encountered. For example, with strings, the null terminator is used as a sentinel value to denote the end of the string. With ellipsis, the sentinel is typically passed in as the last parameter. Here’s an example of findAverage() rewritten to use a sentinel value of -1

    ```c++
    // The ellipsis must be the last parameter
    double findAverage(int first, ...)
    {
    	// We have to deal with the first number specially
    	int sum{ first };
    
    	// We access the ellipsis through a va_list, so let's declare one
    	std::va_list list;
    
    	// We initialize the va_list using va_start.  The first parameter is
    	// the list to initialize.  The second parameter is the last non-ellipsis
    	// parameter.
    	va_start(list, first);
    
    	int count{ 1 };
    	// Loop indefinitely
    	while (true)
    	{
    		// We use va_arg to get parameters out of our ellipsis
    		// The first parameter is the va_list we're using
    		// The second parameter is the type of the parameter
    		int arg{ va_arg(list, int) };
    
    		// If this parameter is our sentinel value, stop looping
    		if (arg == -1)
    			break;
    
    		sum += arg;
    		++count;
    	}
    
    	// Cleanup the va_list when we're done.
    	va_end(list);
    
    	return static_cast<double>(sum) / count;
    }
    
    int main()
    {
    	std::cout << findAverage(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1) << '\n';
    	std::cout << findAverage(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, -1) << '\n';
    }
    ```

  - **Method 3: Use a decoder string**

    ```c++
    // The ellipsis must be the last parameter
    double findAverage(std::string decoder, ...)
    {
    	double sum{ 0 };
    
    	// We access the ellipsis through a va_list, so let's declare one
    	std::va_list list;
    
    	// We initialize the va_list using va_start.  The first parameter is
    	// the list to initialize.  The second parameter is the last non-ellipsis
    	// parameter.
    	va_start(list, decoder);
    
    	int count = 0;
    	// Loop indefinitely
    	while (true)
    	{
    		char codetype{ decoder[count] };
    		switch (codetype)
    		{
    		default:
    		case '\0':
    			// Cleanup the va_list when we're done.
    			va_end(list);
    			return sum / count;
    
    		case 'i':
    			sum += va_arg(list, int);
    			++count;
    			break;
    
    		case 'd':
    			sum += va_arg(list, double);
    			++count;
    			break;
    		}
    	}
    }
    
    
    int main()
    {
    	std::cout << findAverage("iiiii", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) << '\n';
    	std::cout << findAverage("iiiiii", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) << '\n';
    	std::cout << findAverage("iiddi", 1, 2, 3.5, 4.5, 5) << '\n';
    }
    ```

  

  **Recommendations for safer use of ellipsis**

  - First, if possible, do not use ellipsis at all!
  - Second, if you do use ellipsis, do not mix expected argument types within your ellipsis if possible.
  - Third, using a count parameter or decoder string as part of the argument list is generally safer than using a sentinel as an ellipsis parameter. 

  

  ​		To improve upon ellipses-like functionality, C++11 introduced `parameter packs` and `variadic templates`, which offers functionality similar to ellipses, but with strong type checking. However, significant usability challenges impeded adoption of this feature.

  In C++17, [fold expressions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/fold) were added, which significantly improves the usability of parameter packs, to the point where they are now a viable option.
