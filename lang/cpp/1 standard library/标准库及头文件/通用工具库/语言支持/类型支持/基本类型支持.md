The fixed-width integers have two downsides that are typically raised：

- First, the fixed-width integers are not guaranteed to be defined on all architectures.

- Second, if you use a fixed-width integer, it may be slower than a wider type on some architectures. 

  > f you need an integer that is guaranteed to be 32-bits, you might decide to use `std::int32_t`, but your CPU might actually be faster at processing 64-bit integers.

most compilers define and treat *std::int8_t* and *std::uint8_t* (and the corresponding fast and least fixed-width types) identically to types *signed char* and *unsigned char* respectively. It’s best to avoid *std::int8_t* and *std::uint8_t* (and the related fast and least types) altogether (use *std::int16_t* or *std::uint16_t* instead).

### std::int8_t / ustd::int8_t likechar / unsigned char

most compilers define and treat `std::int8_t` and `std::uint8_t` (and the corresponding fast and least fixed-width types) identically to types `signed char` and `unsigned char` respectively. 

```c++
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::int8_t myint{65}; // initialize myint with value 65
    std::cout << myint;    // you're probably expecting this to print 65

    return 0;
}
```



### fast and least

The fast types (``std::int_fast#_t`` and ``std::uint_fast#_t``) provide the fastest signed/unsigned integer type with a width of at least # bits (where # = 8, 16, 32, or 64). 

The least types (``std::int_least#_t`` and ``std::uint_least#_t``) provide the smallest signed/unsigned integer type with a width of at least # bits (where # = 8, 16, 32, or 64).

```c++
#include <cstdint> // for fixed-width integers
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "least 8:  " << sizeof(std::int_least8_t) * 8 << " bits\n";
	std::cout << "least 16: " << sizeof(std::int_least16_t) * 8 << " bits\n";
	std::cout << "least 32: " << sizeof(std::int_least32_t) * 8 << " bits\n";
	std::cout << '\n';
	std::cout << "fast 8:  " << sizeof(std::int_fast8_t) * 8 << " bits\n";
	std::cout << "fast 16: " << sizeof(std::int_fast16_t) * 8 << " bits\n";
	std::cout << "fast 32: " << sizeof(std::int_fast32_t) * 8 << " bits\n";

	return 0;
}

/*
least 8:  8 bits
least 16: 16 bits
least 32: 32 bits

fast 8:  8 bits
fast 16: 64 bits  
fast 32: 64 bits
*/
```

> on the author’s machine, 64-bit integers are faster to process than 16-bit and 32-bit integers.



### Integral best practices

### std::size_t

**std::size_t** is defined as an unsigned integral type, and it is typically used to represent the size or length of objects.

Much like an integer can vary in size depending on the system, *std::size_t* also varies in size. *std::size_t* is guaranteed to be unsigned and at least 16 bits, but on most systems will be equivalent to the address-width of the application. 

operator returns a value of type *std::size_t*。
